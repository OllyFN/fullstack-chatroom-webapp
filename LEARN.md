# Learning
This project taught me a lot about web sockets and database management. I don't believe I have the best solutions for the problems I encountered during this project, but I can imagine they're good examples that people can learn from.

# Navigation
I have added loads of comments to make navigation through the code easy, as well as split the server and client into two folders. If you're curious about the networking aspect of this project, most of it is handled inside the server folder, as well as in Chat.tsx and main.tsx inside the client folder.

# Resources
[Concise SQL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OdVJbNCSso) <br />
Everything I know about SQL is due to this video. Before this project, I knew very little about SQL, whereas now I can work with SQL pretty efficiently. <br />
[Socket.io docs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/) <br />
This is where I learned everything about socket.io. <br />
[Mozilla promise docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) <br />
This project involved quite a few promises, and this was the go-to resource I used when I was learning promises. It's very comprehensive and has a helpful diagram to assist beginners. (I did know promises pretty well before this project, but I still recommend this resource as it helped me a lot).

# Packages & Tools
As I did remove the package.json file from the repo for easier navigation, I included all the packages (excluding packages installed from the Vite template) and tools I used here: <br />
[Vite with React-TS template](https://vitejs.dev/) <br />
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) <br />
[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) <br />
[socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) <br />
[socket.io-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client) <br />
[mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) <br />

# Thank you
Thanks for checking out my repo. I really appreciate it, and any feedback or even a code review would be incredibly valuable to me as I always aim to improve my code and grow as a developer.
